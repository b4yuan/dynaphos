# About the project
A fully differentiable and biologically plausible simulation of prosthetic vision, which can be used for end-to-end optimization.

## Installation
`pip install dynaphos`

## Getting Started
- Run the `test` suite.
- See the `examples` directory for simple use cases.

## Citation

## Experiments
For the end-to-end optimization experiments in our BioRxiv publication see [this repository](https://github.com/neuralcodinglab/viseon/tree/dynaphos-paper).
All other code that was used for the experiments in our publication can me made available on request.
